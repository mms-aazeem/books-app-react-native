# books-app-react-native
One of the simplest mobile applications I build front-end with React Native is a Book app for a good reader. As a complete beginner in mobile application development, building a simple Book app can be a great way to get started with React Native. There should be screens to login or register for the book app. The books list should be displayed and there should be a way to sort the books category wise. If user clicked on a book user should be navigated to the details such as author, title of the particular book. And user should be able to search the book using its name.

Features to be implemented in the book app
• User Login & Registration screens
• Navigation (Drawer or Tab Bar)
• Books Lists & Categories Lists
• Books Details screen (including author, description, book cover photo, price, etc.)
• Book Search functionality
